## My process

The HTML was organized using several divisions to facilitate styling. CSS styling was done using flexbox for the desktop version and CSS grid for the mobile version, in which one of the boxes in the desktop version was made using the position and translation properties, to position itself in the correct place. The rest was using properties such as padding, margin, font-size to organize the texts and images within their respective boxes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
